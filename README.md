# ArcTouch Front End Challenge - Helder Santos

Hi everyone!

I'm very pleased to participate in this selection process. The challenge has some small details in the layout that are quite interesting to produce in code, such as the dynamic borders of the features or even the responsiveness of the header.

I hope you guys enjoy the result and see you next time!

## Usage

```
npm install
grunt build
open dist/index.html
```
